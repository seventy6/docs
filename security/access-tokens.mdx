## QuickStart Guide

#### Learn how Access Keys in the The Auth API

To interact with The Auth API to manage resources such as APIs or keys, you need an 'Access Token'.

Tokens are scoped per project and you can fine tune their access permissions when creating a key or update later on the fly.

When you make a request to The Auth API, you need to include your access token in the request's Headers.

`"x-api-key": [YOUR_AUTHAPI_ACCESS_KEY]`

### How to create an Access Token

Access keys must be generated in your [Dashboard](https://app.theauthapi.com) . You can create multiple keys in your account.

### What should I do if a access token is leaked?

If you leak a token - for instance, by accidentally checking it in to version control - you should immediately revoke the token and replace it with a new one. Tokens are secrets, and should never be exposed publicly.
