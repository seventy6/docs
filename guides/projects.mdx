### What is an API project?

Think of a API project as a collection of access tokens, API keys, webhooks, analytics all bound to a single domain e.g. an API within your stack, a client app vs. a serverside application, a product or even an environment.

For example, a customer can create a project per API service... For example, The Cat API or The Dog API would be two unique projects in our account.

However, projects can be used in your organisation however you feel fit to use them.

#### What are project environments?

The platform currently enables you to create projects in either: `test` or `live` mode.

Having the two spaces enables you to keep your test keys separated, that you know will only ever be used in your local and preview environments. There is no difference in the infrastructure behind the environment.

Projects and Keys are prepended with the markers:

`Live live_1i1AdjSvM5UsF---------------------`

`Test test_1i1AdjSvM5UsF---------------------`

In the UI, you will see a toggle to switch between environments: test and live.
