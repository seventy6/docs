**The Auth API** enables you to connect 3rd party platform supporting a https request, to listen to realtime events. Webhooks are particularly useful for asynchronous events such as when a new API key is generated, first used, deleted or updated. We also support events for Auth Access and Project events.

### Supported events

| Type            | Event      | Trigger                                       | Notes                                                       |
| --------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Keys**    | Created    | Fires the moment a new Key is created         | API Key payloads will contain the API Key.                  |
|                 | Deleted    | Fires the moment the API is deleted           |                                                             |
|                 | Updated    | Fires any time the key is updated             | The metadata you choose to store on the key can be changed. |
|                 | First Used | Fires the first time the key is authenticated |                                                             |
| **Access Keys** | Created    | Fires when a new access key is generated      | Access Key payloads will contain the Access Keys token.     |
|                 | Deleted    | Fires when the access key is deleted          |                                                             |
|                 | Updated    | Fires when the access key is updated          |                                                             |
| **Projects**    | Updated    | Fires when the project details get updated    |                                                             |

#### What are webhooks?

A webhook enables the Auth API to push real-time notifications to your app. Auth API uses HTTPS to send these notifications to your app as a JSON payload. You can then use these notifications to execute actions in your backend systems. To learn more, see Auth API webhook events overview.

### Steps to receive webhooks

You can start receiving event notifications in your app or in a 3rd platform by following these steps:

- Identify the events you want to monitor and the event payloads to parse.
- Create a webhook endpoint as an HTTP endpoint (URL) on your local server or with a 3rd party like Zapier.
- Handle requests from Auth API by parsing each event object and returning `2xx` response status codes.
- Test that your webhook endpoint is working properly using our test connection feature.
- If you are coding your own endpoint, deploy your webhook endpoint so it’s a publicly accessible HTTPS URL.
- Register your publicly accessible HTTPS URL in the Auth API dashboard.

Creating Your first hook
Head to your (dashboard)[https://app.theauthapi.com] . Pick the project you want to tie your endpoint to and scroll to 'Webhooks'. Click '+ Create New Hook' and follow the instructions.

#### Creating a webhook via the API

If you prefer a programmatic approach, you can create, update and delete webhooks (or any entity in The Auth API), head to our API docs - https://docs.theauthapi.com/

```CURL curl.txt
curl --location 'https://api.theauthapi.com/webhooks' \
--header 'x-api-key: REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_FOUND_IN_YOUR_ACCOUNT' \
--data '{
    "name": "only required fields webhook",
    "url": "https://webhook.site/3d224d6e-b525-45dd-9a60-5581df9264b9",
    "projectId": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    "topics": [
        "api-key.created"
    ],
    "httpMethod": "POST",
    "status": "live"
}'
```

```javascript HelloWorld.js
var request = require("request");
var options = {
  method: "POST",
  url: "https://api.theauthapi.com/webhooks",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_FOUND_IN_YOUR_ACCOUNT",
  },
  body: '{\n    "name": "only required fields webhook",\n    "url": "https://webhook.site/3d224d6e-b525-45dd-9a60-5581df9264b9",\n    "projectId": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PROJECT_ID",\n    "topics": [\n        "api-key.created"\n    ],\n    "httpMethod": "POST",\n    "status": "live"\n}',
};
request(options, function (error, response) {
  if (error) throw new Error(error);
  console.log(response.body);
});
```

### Building your own webhook endpoint

Creating a webhook endpoint is no different from creating any other page on your website. It’s an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint on your server with a URL. For local testing e.g. http://localhost:3000 consider using something like (ngrok)[https://ngrok.com/] to route requests to your local machine. When it's ready to launch, it must be running over HTTPS on a publically accessible domain. You can use one endpoint to handle several different event types at once or set up individual endpoints for specific events.

#### Testing your endpoint

When creating your webhook, you can test your endpoint. It's important to test that the endpoint is up and running and receiving events successfully.

#### How to no-code an endpoint

The Auth API webhooks make it super simple to connect 3rd party applications like (zapier.com)[https://zapier.com/], (automate.io)[https://automate.io/], (stripe.com)[https://stripe.com/] etc. to ensure you're able to use the platform without any developer skills.
