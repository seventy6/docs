Listen for events on your project so your integration can automatically trigger reactions.

The Auth API uses webhooks to notify your application when an event happens in your project. Webhooks are particularly useful for asynchronous events such as when a new API key is generated, first used, deleted or updated. We also support events for Auth Access and Project events.

Supported events

Event
Trigger
Notes

API Keys Created Fires the moment a new Key is created
API Key payloads will contain the API Key.

Deleted
Fires the moment the API is deleted

Updated
Fires any time the key is updated. For example, the metadata you choose to store on the key can be changed.

First Used
Fires the first time the key is authenticated

Access Keys Created Fires when a new access key is generated Access Key payloads will contain the Access Keys token

Deleted Fires when the access key is deleted

Updated
Fires when the access key is updated

Projects Updated Fires when the project details get updated

What are webhooks?
A webhook enables the Auth API to push real-time notifications to your app. Auth API uses HTTPS to send these notifications to your app as a JSON payload. You can then use these notifications to execute actions in your backend systems. To learn more, see Auth API webhook events overview.

Steps to receive webhooks
You can start receiving event notifications in your app or in a 3rd platform by following these steps:

Identify the events you want to monitor and the event payloads to parse.
Create a webhook endpoint as an HTTP endpoint (URL) on your local server or with a 3rd party like Zapier.
Handle requests from Auth API by parsing each event object and returning 2xx response status codes.
Test that your webhook endpoint is working properly using our test connection feature.
If you are coding your own endpoint, deploy your webhook endpoint so it’s a publicly accessible HTTPS URL.
Register your publicly accessible HTTPS URL in the Auth API dashboard.

Creating Your first hook
Head to your dashboard. Pick the project you want to tie your endpoint to and scroll to 'Webhooks'. Click '+ Create New Hook' and follow the instructions.

Creating a webhook via the API
If you prefer a programmatic approach, you can create, update and delete webhooks (or any entity in The Auth API), head to our API docs - https://docs.theauthapi.com/

Building your own webhook endpoint
Creating a webhook endpoint is no different from creating any other page on your website. It’s an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint on your server with a URL. For local testing e.g. http://localhost:3000 consider using something like ngrok to route requests to your local machine. When it's ready to launch, it must be running over HTTPS on a publically accessible domain. You can use one endpoint to handle several different event types at once or set up individual endpoints for specific events.

Testing your endpoint
When creating your webhook, you can test your endpoint. It's important to test that the endpoint is up and running and receiving events successfully.

How to no-code an endpoint
The Auth API webhooks make it super simple to connect 3rd party applications like zapier.com, automate.io, stripe.com etc. to ensure you're able to use the platform without any developer skills.
